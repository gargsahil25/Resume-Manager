==''Current Progress''==
*Its an android app for Placement Portal of my College.
*All students in college have an Account on this portal.This app provides easy access to all live update, new companies visiting, Application Submissions etc.
*For this, I have written some Server-side APIs which takes data in raw form from main server, encodes it in json. This json-encoded data is sent to app, which is further decoded on device.
*Manual updation of comapies data and announcements.
*It uses Sqlite DB to store information on device, once retrieved from Server.

==''For future''==
* Adding push updates about any new announcement or company.
* Pull to Refresh is also under process.
* Currently, it is specific to portal of my college only, But I am thinking of making it generalised. So that, it can be used for any of placement portals.
