Current Progress:
It's an android app for Placement Portal of my College.
All students in college have an Account on this portal.This app provides easy access to all live update, new companies visiting, Application Submissions etc.
For this, I have written some Server-side API's which takes data in raw form from main server, encodes it in json. This json-encoded data is sent to app, which is further decoded on device.
Manual updation of comapies data and announcements.
It uses Sqlite DB to store information on device, once retrieved from Server.

For future:
Thinking of adding push updates about any new announcement or company.
Pull to Refresh is also under process.
Currently, it is specific to portal of my college only, But I am thinking of making it generalised. so that, it can be used for any of placement portals.
